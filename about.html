        ">About</p>
            
        <p>I am collecting coins since from 2013. I started collecting Indian republic coins initially. I mostly try to collect coins from friends, relatives and through coin hunt by visiting different old items' shops. Through these years of coin collecting I got many experiences. From these, I want to give some tips-</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If you are new in this hobby, try to get proper knowledge first, there are many people out there who can take advantage of having less knowledge.
            </li>
            <li>
                Try to complete the set, like yearwise or statewise.
            </li>
            <li>
                Try not to spend money on common coins, you can have them easily now or then.
            </li>
            <li>
                Before purchasing any coin seek advice of experienced collectors about their price.
